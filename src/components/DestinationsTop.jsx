        With myriad places to visit, Sri Lanka is a little paradise isle full of surprising variety. You can swap the chaos of a city for a
        tranquil beach in an hour or less, or switch from tropical heat to cool heights and cloud forests for a few more. There are
        mountains to climb, waves to surf, whales to watch, history to revisit, jungles to explore, even elephants to meet. The
        destinations in Sri Lanka are wide and varied and we’ll gladly share them with you in the very best way.
